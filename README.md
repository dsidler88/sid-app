A project sharing application using GraphQL (Grafbase), NextJS 13, and Typescript.

- To be honest there's a lot left to be done, but I'm happy with the patterns learned.
  User can upload a project, view other users' projects, view "related projects" based on user, etc.
- As with most of my learning projects, I apologize for some of the messy bits and over-commenting.
- There's also some random extra features like calling test APIs out of nowhere. Spent a good amount of time testing upload behind a proxy, but it seems to be impossible. Dear diary,
- Missing all deployment code, but i will not be deploying this
- Oh well, moving on.

Be sure to save grafbase sdk as dev dependency, in yarn with --dev

initialize a grafbase project with:

```
npx grafbase init --config-format typescript
```

to start local grafbase dev server:
`npx grafbase dev`

- NEXTAUTH_SECRET
  -- generated by the openSSL command: openssl rand -base64 32
  This is needed in both the grafbase folder, .env as well as the root of the project's .ev
